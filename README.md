# Urban development intensity
## Contrasting inequality in urban development intensity from the perspective of global North-South differences
***Abstract:*** Cities globally have undertaken the dominant economic and social changes of human activities, widely recognized as key determining factor in achieving Sustainable Development Goals. Urban development intensity is scientific basis for instructing urban development guidelines. In this research, we proposed framework for evaluating global urban development intensity based on multi-source data to compare the spatial heterogeneity of global North-South 6,986 urban units with a total area of 674,071 km2. We developed global 1-km gridded urban development intensity layer, which we used to quantify the intensity characterized for four essential stressors of building 3D forms, population, traffic instructions and nighttime lights. Our results show that indicated that urban development intensity discrepancies varied across global North-South cities, particularly in East and Southeast Asia with excessive urban sprawl in low development level. The distribution of urban development intensity across cities were still inequitable and unbalanced in Global South countries. At intracity level, cities in global South generally exhibited high core and low periphery heterogeneous development pattern, in contrast to the balanced development in global North cities.

**Overview of the study design**. a Conceptual framework for urban development intensity based on four sources’ composition on global urban of building 3D forms, population, nighttime lights and transportation roads. b Data are processed and consolidated into raster integrating the urban development intensity into a grid with a resolution of 1-km at Mollweide equal area projection. This study selected various aspects (e.g., weighted geometric mean and equal weighted arithmetic mean model) for result verification to determine the scientific validity of the assessment system. c Statistical methods to analyze the spatial inequality index in urban development intensity, the detected hotspots’ clusters are characterized using the spatial autocorrelation of bivariate Moran’s I and K-Medoids clustering for the specific adaptive urban development.
